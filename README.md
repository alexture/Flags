# Red, white and blue

**A simple website where you can filter country flags by whether they include the color(s) red, white, or blue.**

## Progress

Not live yet. See [v1 milestone](https://github.com/alexture/Flags/milestone/1) to know what's needed for the first version to go live!

## My motivation

This is a small project. I'm a beginner and this is based on [the CS50 introduction to computer science online course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/).

## About the project

Since I haven't found a decent database of flags and their colors, I also want to make the database public and easy to clone. (I might host it somewhere else just for that âˆ’ we'll see when I get there.)

# Wanna help?

I'm doing this to learn and improve and will happily welcome advice and contributions. You can create issues if you want, but I can't guarantee I'll know how to implement anything you suggest :)
